- Sensitive information disclosure
- Privilege escalation in component logic

**Response Time**: 3-7 days

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure without authentication
- Limited XSS in non-critical components
- DoS through component misuse
- Insecure default configurations

**Response Time**: 7-14 days

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers Using Fine-Use

#### Component Usage
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Safe usage
<Button onClick={handleClick} disabled={isLoading}>
  {sanitizedText}
</Button>

// ‚ùå Unsafe usage - don't use dangerouslySetInnerHTML
<Button dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} />
```

#### Theme Customization
```css
/* ‚úÖ Safe theme customization */
:root {
  --fu-primary: #007bff;
  --fu-danger: #dc3545;
}

/* ‚ùå Unsafe - don't use user input directly */
:root {
  --fu-primary: #{userProvidedColor};
}
```

#### Form Handling
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Safe form handling
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const sanitizedData = sanitize(formData);
  submitForm(sanitizedData);
};

// ‚ùå Unsafe - validate and sanitize all inputs
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  submitForm(rawFormData);
};
```
